Copyright (c) 2025, Sparrow001

Copyright shall be retained by this individual for all works completed by said invidiual, unless a separate copyright status is present due to copyright law or a physically written agreement. In other words, this is the default copyright/license unless a more specific one is agreed upon for a specific project.

In the case of volunteer work, this license stands as an additional clarification of already existing copyright law, which states most volunteer work done for an organization has its copyright held by the Volunteer, not the organization. 

1. Definitions:

  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
  the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
  to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
  submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
  or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
  the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
  means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
  to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
  communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
  and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
  Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
  excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
  
  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
  on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
  subsequently incorporated within the Work.
  
  "This individual" refers to Sparrow001.
  
  "Work" refers to any project, file, code, or any other thing authored by Sparrow001.

2. Demonstration of License
  All works by this individual will automatically have this license. However, an explicit license may be written somewhere such as the package.json file in a project. The presence of the explicit line indicates that the work is owned by this individual and is subject to the terms of this agreement. The location of the work is irrelevant, and it may be housed in a personal or organizational repository, some other cloud medium, or even physical works.   
3. Granting of License:
  A license to use/display a work done by this individual shall automatically be granted to an organization upon publishing code intended for their use, provided that this individual is doing work as a volunteer for that organization. Otherwise, a license for other works such as personal projects must be manually granted by this individual. A license to use only applies to a singular work, and multiple must be granted if multiple works are desired. Derivative works, upon approval of this individual, shall automatically be granted a license to use the work. 
4. Execution and Revocation of License:
   This license shall apply to all works in the future and past. Organizations that use any past work shall automatically be granted a license to use, provided they meet the conditions above. A license may be revoked at any time. Upon revocation of a license, the individual or organization must delete any licensed works from their repositories, codebases, or any other medium of storage, as well as take down anything related to the work such as, but not limited to, resulting websites, mobile applications, desktop applications, or plugins. Upon revocation of a license to an individual with a derivative work, all works that have not recieved significant modifications (Complete replacement or uniquely different) must be removed in the same fashion as above.
5. Redistribution, Contributions:
       Upon the grant of a license to use, individuals/organizations may use or redistrbute a work only with the permission of this individual. Any contributors that provide a contribution to the work, provided the contribution is not a complete replacement and uniquely different than said work, shall surrender their copyright of any modification to this individual. However, contributors will be entitled to be listed as a contributor in the work, if they so choose. In other words, contributors grant this individual an exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, sublicensable license to reproduce, distribute, display, make, use, sell, modify, and otherwise exploit any contribution where, when, and how this indvidual pleases, including the ability to take down the contribution as a part of a larger work as demonstrated in section 4. Derivative works may only be created with the permission of this individual, and they are bound to this license agreement. In the case that the license is revoked, derivative works sharing a high similarity as the original work may be subject to takedowns. 
6. Limitation of Liability:
  In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to the licensed individual/organization for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use a work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
